# Final Fantasy Personal Project

This is my personal project which I have decided to continue after numerous changes to what I was going to do.
Presentation will be what the characters page will be.
Stretch goals will be what the real project is about.
It a page which gives out data about Final Fantasy characters.
It is going to be an ongoing project where in any collected new data will be added.
As new games, characters, and mobile apps are build, the final fantasy world is just increasing.
The aim is for my current data base which I have collected from apis, wiki, and other related searches to be all in one place for everyone who loves FF to enjoy.
Start with npm run dev as a command in the terminal.


# Plan of attack
- [x] Set up repo
- [x] Update ReadMe to have project outline, mvp, and stretches
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Update database with files collected
- [x] Make Header, App, Character List components
- [x] Show all character names or maybe more ?
- [ ] Design page

# Stretch
- [x] Make a route so it works like CORS disabled
- [ ] Change the main page to have search inputs
- [ ] Make Another Page for each Final Fantasy games 1 to 15 (maybe include remakes and mobile games as well)
- [ ] Be able to Add content on the page for new data such as new Characters, games, etc
- [ ] Make it so it only shows the characters name and then it show the rest of the details if clicked.


# Notes
- Made a component to clear mvp and just show characters
- Made another component where data is fetch from on server - aka cors disabled (work in progress)
- Made another component where in the css was utilised and changed the layour from an unordered list to a table
- Acheived the purpose of the personal project- its something I am interested in and will most likely build some more features later on
